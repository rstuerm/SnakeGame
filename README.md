# SnakeGame

This is a simple C++ game coded with an object-oreintated programming style. It requires the SDL2 library for user input and output. 

This weekend project was created as an iteration for some past code I had done, which had been motivated by my 8-Bit CPU project. Part of my goal for my 8-Bit CPU project was to get snake running on the computer that I designed. To prepare for this, I created a simple snake game in C++ to plan an efficient code structure that would translate well to assembly language and the instruction set of my 8-Bit CPU. In the iteration of the game posted here, I decided to build upon the initial game, utilizing more aspects of C++ to create a more sophisticated program.
